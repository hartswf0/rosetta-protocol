# Case Study: [Phenomenon Name]
**Logline:** [Distill the entire conflict into one declarative sentence linking a medium to a power shift.]

**Disturbance Window:** [Start Date] â€“ [End Date]
**Media in Conflict:** `[Primary Medium #1]` vs. `[Primary Medium #2]`

---
### Core Tension
<!-- In one paragraph, define the central Innisian/Hallian conflict. This is your thesis. -->
[e.g., This case study analyzes the clash between a centralized, time-biased institution's monopoly of knowledge and a decentralized, space-biased vernacular that used a new medium to challenge its authority.]

## 1. The Struggle (Hall)
*Map the double movement of power.*

#### **[Containment]**
*How the dominant bloc tried to police meaning and control the narrative.*

*   **Tactic 1: [Define the action, e.g., `Strategic Re-framing`].**
    *   **How it worked:** [Explain the mechanism. e.g., By framing user activity as "market manipulation," legacy media incorporated resistance into a narrative of criminality, neutralizing its political charge.]
    *   **Key Artifact:** [Cite the single best source that proves this tactic.]

*   **Tactic 2: [Define the action, e.g., `Infrastructural Proscription`].**
    *   **How it worked:** [Explain the mechanism. e.g., The platform used its architectural power to halt circulation, demonstrating a direct, non-narrative form of control.]
    *   **Key Artifact:** [Cite the single best source that proves this tactic.]

#### **[Resistance]**
*How the popular forces answered back, subverting control.*

*   **Tactic 1: [Define the action, e.g., `Vernacular Weaponization`].**
    *   **How it worked:** [Explain the mechanism. e.g., The community created a private slang ('diamond hands') that functioned as an oral tradition, building solidarity and resisting external interpretation.]
    *   **Key Artifact:** [Cite the single best source that proves this tactic.]

*   **Tactic 2: [Define the action, e.g., `Counter-Hegemonic Coalition`].**
    *   **How it worked:** [Explain the mechanism. e.g., The movement successfully articulated its struggle in populist terms, forcing an unlikely alliance of politicians to endorse its cause and amplify its narrative.]
    *   **Key Artifact:** [Cite the single best source that proves this tactic.]

## 2. The Bias (Innis)
*Analyze the media that shaped the battlefield.*

*   **<Dominant_Medium>: `[Name of the Medium]`**
    *   **Bias & Properties:** [Identify bias (Time/Space) and list its core attributes: e.g., `Space-Biased`: Centralized, hierarchical, capital-intensive, favors administrative control.]
    *   **Role in Struggle:** [Explain how its bias served containment. e.g., Its centralized structure enabled a rapid, top-down response to police the narrative across its entire network.]

*   **<Insurgent_Medium>: `[Name of the Medium]`**
    *   **Bias & Properties:** [Identify bias and properties: e.g., `Time-Biased culture on a Space-Biased platform`: Decentralized, ephemeral, favors oral/vernacular communication, low cost of entry.]
    *   **Role in Struggle:** [Explain how its bias enabled resistance. e.g., Its decentralized nature made it impossible to censor from a single point, while its oral character fostered a resilient, shared identity that resisted external framing.]

---

## 3. The Fable (Gaiman)
*Distill the enduring, archetypal story.*

**The Fable:**
> [Write the core narrative in 1-2 mythic sentences.]

*   **Archetype:** [e.g., The Trickster Fools the King]
*   **Enduring Image:** [e.g., A Diamond in an Ape's Hand]

---

## 4. The 10,000-Year Design
*Propose a system to transmit the fable into the deep future.*

### **Proposal: `[Name of Your Design]`**

*   **<Durable_Artifact>:**
    *   **Substrate & Redundancy:** [What is it and where does it live? e.g., The fable etched on sapphire disks, stored in three separate geological repositories.]

*   **<Living_Ritual>:**
    *   **Practice & Didactic Minimum:** [What is done and what is the core lesson? e.g., An annual lottery simulation where the "house" is designed to lose. The lesson: "Systems can be broken."]

*   **<Perpetual_Custody>:**
    *   **Governance & Succession:** [Who protects it and how is power passed on? e.g., A trust governed by a rotating council of librarians and game designers, with new members chosen by unanimous consent.]
